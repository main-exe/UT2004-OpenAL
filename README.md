# UT2004-OpenAL
Instructions how to enable 3D spatial audio for 'Unreal Tournament 2004' aka UT2004 aka UT2k4.

Intended to be used with **headphones** (stereo). Works with any sound card.  
The difference should be clearly noticeable as sound becomes out-of-head.

Non-native to game solutions to create 3D spatial audio for headphones is done using only 5.1/7.1 channel output and have no elevation.
Having 3D spatial sound directly from audio engine has elevation and is more accurate.  

Instructions and a way to find best sounding HRTF are included in 'Readme.txt' inside release [archive](https://github.com/main-exe/UT2004-OpenAL/releases).

## Note
Included OpenAL Soft library files are patched to fix voice chat which does not work with official OpenAL Soft release.
